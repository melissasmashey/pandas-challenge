DATA ANALYSIS of Trends:

Overall:
The total amount of customers analyzed were 576 customers(players), 780 purchases, average purchase price of $3.05, and Total Revenue of $2,379.77

Gender Analysis:

Out of the 576 customers, 84% were male, 14% were female, and 2% were other/non-disclosed. 
Even though the Male gender made up the most purchase count with 652 purchases and a $3.02 average purchase price, the other/non-disclosed group had a higher average price of $3.35. 
The Other/non-disclosed group's higher average price of $3.35 can be due to the small purchase count of 15 items. There is less variance then the male's larger purchase count to drive their average purchase value down. 
Looking deeper into the female group, the females tended to purchase more compared to their customer base count. They purchased 14.48% of the total purchases vs their customer base count of 14.06%.
The female group also spent more per purchase which tells me that they were not opposed to the higher priced items.

Age Analysis:

The data indicated that majority of the customer base were from the 20-24 age group with 44.79% of the total customer count. There was a strong dominace with this age group since there was a 26% gap between next highest gender group(15-19) with only 18.58% of the customer base.
Looking into the age group purchasing trends, the 20-24 group showed a stronger inclination to purchase with 46.79% of the total purchase count versus their customer base count of 44.79%.
